From quantum mechanics to fluid dynamics, this book systematically treats the broad scope of computer modeling and simulations, describing the fundamental theory behind each level of approximation. Berendsen evaluates each stage in relation to its applications giving the reader insight into the possibilities and limitations of the models. Practical guidance for applications and sample programs in Python are provided. With a strong emphasis on molecular models in chemistry and biochemistry, this book will be suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on molecular modeling and simulation within physics, biophysics, physical chemistry and materials science. It will also be a useful reference to all those working in the field.},

Manipulation of the natural antecedents of coat buttoning produced swift acquisition of the required component responses in both Ss. These skills generalized successfully across materials (other coats) and time (6-mo follow-up). Such antecedent enhancement procedures may be of value to the extent that they offer a consistent means of presenting subtle, interactive interventions without requiring advanced teaching skills on the part of staff.
